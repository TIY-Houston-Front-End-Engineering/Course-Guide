# Constructors

## Description
Copy the included `constructors.js` to a new project. Add an index.html that includes it. Answer all the questions and upload to __gh-pages__.

Keep in mind in the examples in `constructors.js` I need to be able to test them in __gh-pages__ on the console. Also make sure there are no javascript errors and check your code in [js hint](http://jshint.com/). Finally make sure it is formatted/indented correctly. Code is in place that validates each answer. It will currently say: `Assertion failed` for each question. Once you answer the question correctly that will go away. Use this to check your work.


## Objectives

### Learning Objectives

After completing this assignment, you should…

* Understand how constructor functions work in JavaScript


### Performance Objectives

After completing this assignment, you be able to effectively use

* [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/)



## Details

### Deliverables

* A repo containing at least:
  - the `constructors.js` file
  - a branch called `gh-pages`

### Requirements

* No JSHint warnings or errors


## Hard Mode
In the `constructors.js` there is a bonus question at the bottom. This is your hard mode.


## Notes

If you are finished with your normal mode before 7pm I would urge you to try the hard mode.
