**Office hours and one-on-one instruction**

A teacher or TA will be available Monday-Friday from 9 AM to 5 PM at minimum. During lab time, you can schedule one-on-one time with either of us. After hours, we may be available in the classroom or in Slack, which we use for group communication.

**Holidays**

Any holidays wil be announced with ample time.

**Materials**

All students must bring their own MacBook laptop to class. We recommend the 13" MacBook Air or Pro. The only upgrade (if any) you should purchase is 8GB of RAM.

Your MacBook must be running [OS X Yosemite](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/os-x-yosemite/id915041082?mt=12), which is a free upgrade from the App Store. [Download and install it](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/os-x-yosemite/id915041082?mt=12) if you haven't yet.

Accounts to sign up for:

If you don't have an account with any of these, sign up for them now:

2. http://twitter.com
3. http://medium.com
4. http://trello.com (sign-in with your Google account for easier access)

There is no commercial software required for the class. We will install a number of tools to be used, such as a code editor and a chat program, but they will all be free and/or open-source. 

A custom [install script](./extras/ultimate-install-script.sh) will be provided and run the first day of class. This script will install the necessary tools onto your Mac and also modify some of the settings to optimize the machine for programming, battery life, and other improved features.

Learn server-side JS (Node.js) and other JS concepts with these CLI (command line interface) workshops: http://nodeschool.io/#workshoppers

> Install them with npm (i.e. `npm install -g learnyounode`)

Learn another language. Choose one based on a job description you want to feel more qualified for:

1. Learn PHP; the frameworks Symfony, Wordpress, Drupal, and Laravel are built on PHP
- Learn Python; the frameworks Django and Flask are built on Python
- Learn Ruby; the frameworks Rails and Middleman are built on Ruby
- Learn C# (pronounced "C-sharp"); the framework ASP.NET MVC 4.5 is built on C#

**Policies**

Sounds boring, but these are important:

- Absences and timeliness - You can miss up to 4 lectures; after that, your enrollment in career support is forfeit. I don't recommend missing any, as we will be moving very fast! This is to help with expectations: I show up, you show up, we all show up --- and kick ass! :-) Also, please show up on time. We count 2 lates as an absence. All I ask for is general respect of the crew and class so that we can learn without constant hiccups and interruptions!

- Late or incomplete homework - Your homework is due by 9 AM on the assigned day. After that, it is late. If you miss homework assignments, come talk to me, because I know problems and emergencies can happen. However, you will be required to make up for late/incomplete assignments, so don't fall behind! I would rather see a solid attempt on time than a complete assignment late. Solid attempts are not considered late!

- Honor - You are expected to do your own work. If you don't, why are you here? You should use all resources available to you, including open-source code, but copy and pasting open-source code is prohibited: you should use it only for inspiration or as a library in a bigger project. Copying homework is taken very seriously and can result in forfeiting career support.

- Conduct - I run a class based on human decency and respect - I want everyone to be welcome. Generally speaking, if something can be taken the wrong way, be careful how you say it! Have an issue with someone? **If you ever have any issues, just reach out to me or any of The Iron Yard employees. I promise we will represent everyone fairly and equally, and we generally care for the well-being of our students.**
